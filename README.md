### Yet Another S3-backed File System: yas3fs

YAS3FS (Yet Another S3-backed File System) is a [Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)](http://fuse.sourceforge.net)
interface to [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
It was inspired by [s3fs](http://code.google.com/p/s3fs/) but rewritten from scratch to implement
a distributed cache synchronized by [Amazon SNS](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/) notifications.
A web console is provided to easily monitor the nodes of a cluster.

**This is a personal project. No relation whatsoever exists between this project and my employer.**

* It allows to mount an S3 bucket (or a part of it, if you specify a path) as a local folder.
* It works on Linux and Mac OS X.
* For maximum speed all data read from S3 is cached locally on the node, in memory or on disk, depending of the file size.
* Parallel multi-part downloads are used if there are reads in the middle of the file (e.g. for streaming).
* Parallel multi-part uploads are used for files larger than a specified size.
* With buffering enabled (the default) files can be accessed during the download from S3 (e.g. for streaming).
* It can be used on more than one node to create a "shared" file system (i.e. a yas3fs "cluster").
* [SNS](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/) notifications are used to update other nodes in the cluster that something has changed on S3 and they need to invalidate their cache.
* Notifications can be listened using HTTP or [SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) endpoints.
* If the cache grows to its maximum size, the less recently accessed files are removed.
* AWS credentials can be passed using AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID and AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY environment variables.
* In an [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance a [IAM](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/) role can be used to give access to S3/SNS/SQS resources.
* It is written in Python (2.6) using [boto](https://github.com/boto/boto) and [fusepy](https://github.com/terencehonles/fusepy).

### Introduction

This is the logical architecture of yas3fs:

![yas3fs Logical Architecture](http://blog.danilopoccia.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/11/yas3fs.png.scaled500.png)

I strongly suggest to start yas3fs for the first time with the `-d` (debug) option, to see if there is any error.
When everything works it can be interrupted (with `^C`) and restarted to run in background
(it's the default with no `-d` / `-f` options).

To mount an S3 bucket without using SNS (i.e. for a single node):

    yas3fs.py /path/to/mount --url s3://bucket/path 

To persist file system metadata such as attr/xattr yas3fs is using S3 User Metadata.
To mount an S3 bucket without actually writing metadata in it,
e.g. because it is a bucket you mainly use as a repository and not as a file system,
you can use the `--no-metadata` option.

To mount an S3 bucket using SNS and listening to an SQS endpoint:

    yas3fs.py /path/to/mount --url s3://bucket/path --topic TOPIC-ARN --new-queue

To mount an S3 bucket using SNS and listening to an HTTP endpoint (on EC2):

    yas3fs.py /path/to/mount --url s3://bucket/path --topic TOPIC-ARN --ec2-hostname --port N

On EC2 the security group must allow inbound traffic from SNS on the selected port.

On EC2 the command line doesn't need any information on the actual server and can easily be used
within an [Auto Scaling](http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) group.

### Quick Installation

If you want to do a quick test here's the installation procedure depending on the OS flavor (Linux or Mac):

* Create an S3 bucket in the AWS region you prefer.
* You don't need to create anything in the bucket as the initial path (if any) is created by the tool on the first mount.
* If you want to use an existing S3 bucket you can use the `--no-metadata` option to not use user metadata to persist file system attr/xattr.
* Create an SNS topic in the same region as the S3 bucket and write down the full topic ARN (you need it to run the tool if more than one client is connected to the same bucket/path).
* Create a IAM Role that gives access to the S3 and SNS/SQS resources you need or pass the AWS credentials to the tool using environment variables (see `-h`).
* I used the `eu-west-1` region in my sample, but you can replace that with any region you want. If no region is specified it defaults to `us-east-1`.

**On EC2 with Amazon Linux 2012.09**

    sudo yum -y install fuse fuse-libs
    sudo yum -y install git # You need to install git on S3-backed AMI
    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip install -U boto fusepy
    sudo sed -i'' 's/^# *user_allow_other/user_allow_other/' /etc/fuse.conf # uncomment user_allow_other
    git clone git://github.com/danilop/yas3fs.git
    cd yas3fs
    ./yas3fs.py -h # See the usage
    mkdir LOCAL-PATH
    ./yas3fs.py LOCAL-PATH --url s3://BUCKET/PATH --topic TOPIC-ARN --new-queue --region eu-west-1

**On EC2 with Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 LTS**

    sudo aptitude install fuse-utils libfuse2 python-pip
    sudo pip install -U boto fusepy
    sudo sed -i'' 's/^# *user_allow_other/user_allow_other/' /etc/fuse.conf # uncomment user_allow_other
    git clone git://github.com/danilop/yas3fs.git
    cd yas3fs
    ./yas3fs.py -h # See the usage
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/fuse.conf # make it readable by anybody, it is not the default on Ubuntu
    mkdir LOCAL-PATH
    ./yas3fs.py LOCAL-PATH --url s3://BUCKET/PATH --topic TOPIC-ARN --new-queue --region eu-west-1

**On a Mac (tested under Mountain Lion)**

Install FUSE for OS X from <http://osxfuse.github.com>

To install the Python [M2Crypto](http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto) module,
download the most suitable "egg" from
<http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto#Downloads>.

    sudo easy_install M2Crypto-*.egg
    sudo easy_install boto
    sudo easy_install fusepy
    git clone git://github.com/danilop/yas3fs.git
    cd yas3fs
    ./yas3fs.py -h # See the usage
    mkdir LOCAL-PATH
    ./yas3fs.py LOCAL-PATH --url s3://BUCKET/PATH --topic TOPIC-ARN --new-queue --region eu-west-1

If something does not work as expected you can use the `-d` option to run in foreground in debug mode.

**Unmount**

To unmount the file system on Linux:

    fusermount -u LOCAL-PATH

To unmount the file system on a Mac you can use `umount`.

### Full Usage

    yas3fs.py -h

    Usage: yas3fs.py <mountpoint> [options]

    YAS3FS (Yet Another S3-backed File System) is a Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) interface to Amazon S3.

    It allows to mount an S3 bucket (or a part of it, if you specify a path) as a local folder.
    It works on Linux and Mac OS X.
    For maximum speed all data read from S3 is cached locally on the node, in memory or on disk, depending of the file size.
    Parallel multi-part downloads are used if there are reads in the middle of the file (e.g. for streaming).
    Parallel multi-part uploads are used for files larger than a specified size.
    With buffering enabled (the default) files can be accessed during the download from S3 (e.g. for streaming).
    It can be used on more than one node to create a "shared" file system (i.e. a yas3fs "cluster").
    SNS notifications are used to update other nodes in the cluster that something has changed on S3 and they need to invalidate their cache.
    Notifications can be listened using HTTP or SQS endpoints.
    If the cache grows to its maximum size, the less recently accessed files are removed.
    AWS credentials can be passed using AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.
    In an EC2 instance a IAM role can be used to give access to S3/SNS/SQS resources.

### Web console

A web console to easy monitor the nodes of a cluster (i.e. that are listening to the same SNS topic)
is in the "yas3fs-console/" subdirectory.

* AWS credentials can be passed using AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID and AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY environment variables.
* The AWS_REGION environment variable must point to a valid AWS reagion (e.g. eu-west-1)
* In an [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance a [IAM](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/) role can be used to give access to S3/SNS/SQS resources.

It is based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and once "node" is [installed](http://nodejs.org/download/) you can run it with:

    git clone git://github.com/danilop/yas3fs.git
    cd yas3fs/yas3fs-console
    npm install
    node server.js

It is using the 3000 port by default (e.g. "http://localhost:3000"), but you can change it using the PORT environment variable, e.g.:

    export PORT=8080
    node yas3fs-console/server.js

Here’s a sample screenshot of the web interface:

![YAS3FS Console screenshot](http://blog.danilopoccia.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/yas3fs-console.png)

The list of nodes and the attributes are updated dynamically depending on the configuration parameters.

In the future I’d like to add management capabilities as well into the console, such as “cache reset on a node”, or alarms, such as “disk cache is running out of space”.

### Notification Syntax & Use

You can use the SNS topic for other purposes than keeping the cache of the nodes in sync.
Those are some sample use cases:

* You can listen to the SNS topic to be updated on changes on S3 (if done through yas3fs).
* You can publish on the SNS topic to manage the overall "cluster" of yas3fs nodes.

The SNS notification syntax is based on [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](http://www.json.org):

    [ "node_id", "action", ... ]

The following `action`(s) are currently implemented:

* `mkdir` (new directory): `[ "node_id", "mkdir", "path" ]`
* `rmdir` (remove directory): `[ "node_id", "rmdir", "path" ]`
* `mknod` (new empty file): `[ "node_id", "mknod", "path" ]`
* `unlink` (remove file): `[ "node_id", "unlink", "path" ]`
* `symlink` (new symbolic link): `[ "node_id", "symlink", "path" ]`
* `rename` (rename file or directory): `[ "node_id", "rename", "old_path", "new_path" ]`
* `flush` (updated file): `[ "node_id", "flush", "path", "new_md5" ]` (`path` and `new_md5` are optional)
* `md` (updated metadata, e.g. attr/xattr): `[ "node_id", "md", "path", "metadata_name" ]`
* `reset` (reset cache): `[ "node_id", "reset" ]`
* `cache` (change cache config): `[ "node_id", "cache" , "entries" or "mem" or "disk", new_value ]`
* `buffer` (change buffer config): `[ "node_id", "buffer", "size" or "prefetch", new_value ]`
* `prefetch` (change prefetch config): `[ "node_id", "prefetch", "on" or "off" ]`
* `url` (change S3 url): `[ "node_id", "url", "s3://BUCKET/PATH" ]`

Every node will listen to notifications coming from a `node_id` different from its own id.
As an example, if you want to reset the cache of all the nodes in a yas3fs cluster,
you can send the following notification to the SNS topic (assuming there is no node with id equal to `all`):

    [ "all", "reset" ]

To send the notification you can use the SNS web console or any command line tool that supports SNS, such as [AWS CLI](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

In the same way, if you uploaded a new file (or updated an old one) directly on S3 
you can invalidate the caches of all the nodes in the yas3fs cluster for that `path` sending this SNS notification:

    [ "all", "flush", "path" ]

The `path` is the relative path of the file system (`/` corresponding to the mount point)
and doesn't include any S3 path (i.e. prefix) as given in the `--url` option.

To change the size of the memory cache on all nodes, e.g. to bring it from 1GB (the current default) to 10GB,
you can publish (the size is in MB as in the corresponding command line option):

    [ "all", "cache", "mem", 10240 ]

To change the size of the disk cache on all nodes, e.g. to bring it from 10GB (the current default) to 1TB,
you can publish (the size is in MB as in the corresponding command line option):

    [ "all", "cache", "disk", 1048576 ]

To change the buffer size used to download the content (and make it available for reads) from the default of 10MB (optimized for a full download speed) to 256KB (optimized for a streaming service) you can use (the size is in KB, as in the corresponding command line option):

    [ "all", "buffer", "size", 256 ]

To change buffer prefetch from the default of 0 to 1 (optimized for sequential access) you can publish:

    [ "all", "buffer", "prefetch", 1 ]

Similarly, to activate download prefetch of all files on all nodes you can use:

    [ "all", "prefetch", "on" ]

To change the multipart upload size to 100MB:

    [ "all", "multipart", "size", 102400 ]

To change the maximum number of parallel threads to use for multipart uploads to 16:

    [ "all", "multipart", "num", 16 ]

To change the maximum number of retries for multipart uploads to 10:

    [ "all", "multipart", "retries", 10 ]

You can even change dinamically the mounted S3 URL (i.e. the bucket and/or the path prefix):

    [ "all", "url", "s3://BUCKET/PATH" ]

To check the status of all the yas3fs instances listening to a topic you can use:

    [ "all", "ping" ]

To the previous message all yas3fs instances will answer publishing a message on the topic with this content:

    [ "id", "status", hostname, number of entries in cache, cache memory size,
      cache disk size, download queue length, prefetch queue length ]
